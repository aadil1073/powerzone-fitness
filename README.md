##  Development Process

### Initial Setup

* Created React project.
* Installed dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material react-router-dom
  ```
* Configured **`BrowserRouter`** in `index.js` for routing.

### Base Layout Creation

* Built **Navbar** with navigation links.
* Created placeholder pages for all sections.

### Section Development

* Developed reusable components for:

  * `HeroSection`
  * `AboutSection`
  * `TrainerSection`
  * `CallToActionSection`
  * `Footer`
* Added images and responsive design.

### One-Page Conversion

* Merged all sections into `Home.jsx` using `<section>` tags with unique IDs.
* Updated navigation to smooth scroll instead of using multiple pages.

### Smooth Scroll Implementation

* Added custom scroll function with offset for sticky navbar:

  ```javascript
  const scrollToSection = (id) => {
    navigate("/");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const el = document.getElementById(id);
      if (!el) return;
      const offset = 70;
      const y = el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset - offset;
      window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: "smooth" });
    }, 100);
  };
  ```

### Styling & Responsiveness

* Applied Material UI breakpoints for mobile & desktop views.
* Added hover effects and consistent brand colors:

* Used `objectFit: "cover"` for uniform image display.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Routing Issues (Blank Pages)

**Issue:** Incorrect component imports and missing `BrowserRouter` wrapper.
**Solution:** Wrapped entire app with `BrowserRouter` and verified all routes.

### 2. Sticky Navbar Covering Section Titles

**Issue:** Default `scrollIntoView` behavior ignored navbar height.
**Solution:** Implemented offset scroll calculation.

### 3. Image Loading Problems

**Issue:** Incorrect file paths and image stretching.
**Solution:** Corrected imports and used `objectFit: "cover"`.
